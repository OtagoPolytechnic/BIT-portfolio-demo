As part of a course for the Grad Dip in Tertiary Education, I decided to add a licence to this repo. It's one of the things that GitHub suggests you can do when you first make an empty repo (the other being to add a readme). 

GitHub provides a lot o help with this process. It's as easy as adding a new file and calling it `LICENCE` (or the other spelling), and a button appears. Clicking that provides all the information needed to decide which kind of licence to add, and then makes adding it really, really simple. The result is a file in your repo with automatically generated details of your licence. 

I chose to license my portfolio with MIT's open source option, which basically gives people the opportunity to reuse parts of my project so long as 
1. they don't plagiarise
2. they attach the original licence to their own work, with attribution

I also discovered that unlicensed work is "all right reserved" by default, so if that's what you want then you don't have to do anything. There are much better options out there, and many people assume that no declaration means free-for-all, so it's always worth consciously picking a licence for your work.
