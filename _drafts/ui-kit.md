For this project, we were briefed to make a UI kit for a travel app. I did a lot of browsing around various UI kit resources online, and found that there are many different approaches to how to present a kit. The example provided in the brief looks like a UI elements kit rather than a set of fully-designed screens, so I will base my kit on several examples I found of UI element sets.

I also researched some travel apps to find out what aspects their UIs had in common.

**Foursquare** uses light blue for a main colour and has a circular theme, with round icons, images and round ends on the buttons. It's also a flat look, which is common to a lot of recent app design.

**TripAdvisor** also has a lot fo circles. Many travel apps had some kind of "star rating", although few used actual stars. This app uses circles, for example. It uses a quite different main colour of a deep green, but there is much less of it than the blue in Foursquare. This means that both apps have an overall light colour scheme.

Other apps also had light blue and circular icons, except Yelp, which is bright red and has icons with no background. Very few had dark themes. All used modern-looking sans-serif type faces, mostly in light or thin fonts.

## My design
I decided to try for a slightly different colour scheme, staying away from the cliche of light blue but keeping consistent with light, cool colours. My instinct was to go with light green, which then inspired me to do something a bit different and design for a nature-based travel app rather than the usual business-based. I would therefore need icons not for hotels and malls, but for beaches, forests, mountains and other natural tourist attractions. Since there aren't many squares or straight edges in nature, I will stick with the circular theme, and perhaps use a leaf icon for star ratings. This also provides consistency with apps people are familiar with.

I have chosen Raleway as my main typeface, using the regular and light weights mostly, as this is consistent with the sans-serif typography of other apps and is also quite a rounded, natural-looking typeface.

## Tools and technique
I noted that many UI kits available online are provided as photoshop files, but when I tried it out I found that every little rectangle ended up on a new layer making it difficult to manage all my shapes and text. Adobe Illustrator seemed a better choice, since it is designed to build shapes and text that can be resized easily. 

I started by building all the basic shapes I would need: small and large circles and rounded rectangles, plus a banner shape for the top of the screen. I used specific measurements using the dialogue box rather than dragging with the mouse, as this was easier to keep all my shapes regular. Once I had the basic set, I alt-dragged to duplicate shapes in order to build all my elements. 

I also noted that all apps have a back arrow and most have a "burger" menu icon as well as other navigation-specific elements. I would also need form elements for when users are leaving feedback about an attraction, including an interface for picking a star rating.

I added text and then colour last, keeping to a limited pallette based on my chosen green with small amounts of a highlight colour.

## Challenges
I had some difficulty figuring out the relative sizes of all the elements. Initially I had all my radio buttons and check boxes too big and other things too small. I had to do some research about the actual pixel sizes of real phone buttons and icons and then work from there.

It was also quite difficult to decide how to arrange elements on the page. I used ruler guides to divide the page into sections, but even then it was hard to know what would go where. In the end I decided to worry about that later, and just designed everything first. This helped to indicate a kind of natural order to things.

Another challenge was deciding how much to make. Some UI kits online have literally every single possible element in every possible state and colour, which seems like far too much. I decided to go with a limited set of just the elements that would be central to a travel app, and then provide main colour, secondary colour, disabled and activated versions of each thing.

## References
I based some of my icons on kits from [Freebiesbug](https://freebiesbug.com/illustrator-freebies/) but did not use any directly as my icon set was different from any on that site, and I had decided to have mine in circles. I also got inspiration from [Icons8](https://icons8.com), but again built all the images myself.

The typeface I used is [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) from Google fonts.
